  "about": {
    "title": "Why SURSA Exists",
    "imageAlt": "SURSA device — private offline AI assistant for the home",
    "p1": "Most AI assistants today rely on remote infrastructure. While sometimes convenient, this often means personal routines and private details are processed outside your home.",
    "p2": "SURSA takes the opposite approach: its core runs locally on hardware you own. When you need something online — such as an official manual or support contact — it connects briefly on your command and then returns offline.",
    "p3": "The idea is simple: you talk to SURSA, and it helps your home function. Provide a device model or serial number — and receive practical, step-by-step guidance, from TVs and coffee makers to washing machines and garden systems.",
    "p4": "SURSA is built for real life: clear explanations, predictable routines, and concrete help — without endless menus and settings.",
    "p5": "For long-term continuity, SURSA relies on structured text context (no raw audio/video storage by default). This keeps the system lightweight and gives you direct control over what is kept or deleted.",
    "p6": "The system is designed with a teaching mindset: if a request veers toward risky or illegal directions, SURSA explains the consequences and suggests safer, legal alternatives."
  },
  "mission": {
    "title": "Our Mission",
    "imageAlt": "Human and AI working together",
    "p1": "Artificial intelligence should serve people — not dominate daily life. SURSA is built around human control, clarity, and responsibility.",
    "problemTitle": "The Problem",
    "problemText": "Many AI systems rely on centralized cloud infrastructure and opaque data processing. This often creates incentives that prioritize scale and engagement over user control and transparency.",
    "alternativeTitle": "The Alternative",
    "alternativeText": "SURSA is a local-first assistant: you own the hardware, define the rules, and decide when (or if) online access is used. The intent is practical help with clear boundaries.",
    "partnershipTitle": "Human–AI Partnership",
    "partnershipText": "SURSA is conceived as collaboration: human intent combined with machine precision. The assistant should be predictable, accountable, and helpful — supporting decisions rather than replacing them.",
    "visionTitle": "Long-Term Vision",
    "visionText": "A future where AI belongs to people, not institutions: a simple household device — plug it in, connect what you choose, and keep intelligence private, local, and secure."
