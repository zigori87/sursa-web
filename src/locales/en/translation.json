    "p3": "At home it acts as a calm family assistant and an extra layer of awareness. At work it supports planning, procedures, and learning. The goal is not a “hacker machine” — it is a practical assistant that encourages lawful, constructive action.",

  "about": {
    "title": "Why SURSA Exists",
    "imageAlt": "SURSA device — a private offline AI assistant for the home",
    "p1": "Most AI assistants rely on remote infrastructure. That can be convenient, but it often means personal routines and private details are processed outside the home.",
    "p2": "SURSA follows the opposite path: the core runs locally on hardware you own. When you need something online — for example an official manual or support contact — it can connect briefly by your command and then return offline.",
    "p3": "The idea is simple: you talk to SURSA, and it helps your home work. Provide a device model name or serial number and get practical, step-by-step guidance — from TVs and coffee makers to washing machines and garden systems.",
    "p4": "SURSA is built for real life: clear explanations, predictable routines, and practical help — without needing you to fight through endless menus and settings.",
    "p5": "For long-term continuity, SURSA is designed around structured text context (not raw audio or video storage by default). This keeps the system lightweight and gives users direct control over what is kept or removed.",
    "p6": "The system is built with a teacher mindset: if a request moves toward unsafe or unlawful behavior, SURSA explains consequences and offers safer, legal alternatives."
  },
  "mission": {
    "title": "Our Mission",
    "imageAlt": "Human and AI working together",
    "p1": "Artificial intelligence should serve people — not dominate everyday life. SURSA is built around human control, clarity, and responsibility.",
    "problemTitle": "The Problem",
    "problemText": "Many AI systems are designed around centralized cloud infrastructure and opaque data processing. This can create incentives that prioritize scale and engagement over user control and transparency.",
    "alternativeTitle": "The Alternative",
    "alternativeText": "SURSA is a local-first assistant: the user owns the hardware, defines the rules, and decides when (or if) online access is used. The intent is practical help with clear boundaries.",
    "partnershipTitle": "Human–AI Partnership",
    "partnershipText": "SURSA is designed as collaboration: human intent plus machine precision. The assistant should be predictable, accountable, and helpful — supporting decisions rather than replacing judgment.",
    "visionTitle": "Long-Term Vision",
    "visionText": "A future where AI belongs to people, not institutions: a simple household device — plug it in, connect what you choose, and keep intelligence private, local, and safe."
